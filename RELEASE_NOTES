RELEASE_NOTES

Enea LINX for Linux
-------------------

Version: 2.6.7
--------------

This is a release of Enea LINX for Linux, containing
the LINX kernel module, LINX Ethernet Connection Manager (CM) module,
LINX TCP CM module, LINX shared memory CM module, the LINX RapidIO CM module,
CMCL module, the LINX library, tools for supervising and for configuring
inter-node communication and the LINX Gateway server.


Main Changes
------------

No extra features added.
No new Connection Managers added.


Supported Linux Kernel Versions
-------------------------------

LINX version 2.6.7 supports new vanilla kernels 3.16.7, 3.17.8, 3.18.21,
3.19.0, 4.1.6. Backward compatibility for LINX version 2.6.6 was not affected.
Vendor specific kernels may require modifications in the LINX source code.


LINX Development Environment Requirements
-----------------------------------------

LINX does not use any unusual features and should be easy to build in any
modern self hosted or cross build environment.


LINX Known Bugs and Limitations
-------------------------------

Once a connection has been setup on an Ethernet interface, the interface's
MTU, address and name must not be changed (e.g. ifconfig eth1 mtu 1000). If
the LINX Ethernet CM detects such a change, it prints an error message to
the kernel ring buffer. Note that from now on, the behaviour of the affected
connections are unpredictable, e.g. signals may be truncated, etc. The only
way to ensure correct behaviour is to re-create the affected connections.

From one Ethernet interface, it is not possible to create multiple connections
to the same destination address. Same applies to TCP/IP CM (IP address instead
of MAC address etc.).

Some kernel versions and distributions require that LINX is built with
LINX_KERNEL_WORKAROUND_1 flag set to yes, see README.

The make system lacks proper dependencies.

If the LINXDISC daemon is killed with SIGKILL, it cannot be restarted due to
lack of cleanup. However, if the user removes the lockfile and established
LINX-connections, the daemon may be started again.

Loading the linx module with a hardcoded linx pool base address used by the
zero-copy feature will generate incorrect pool memory accesses. (LINXCR-1979)

Other Notes
-------------------------------

Older versions of LINX used the linxcfg tool which created both the
connection and link at the same time. The linxcfg tool is delivered with this
package for backwards compatibility but will be removed in upcomming releases.
Users should use the new set of tools described in LINX for Linux UserGuide
manual, e.g. mkethcon and mklink.
